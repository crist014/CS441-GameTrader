    <div>How large is your game collection?</div>
    <p>Have you ever wished you could get more than just a measly
        trade-in credit at GameStop for something you once thought so valuable? Whether your old
        games and systems are collecting dust in a closet, you want more than a $5 credit at GameStop,
        or you just want to experiment and try something new; gamers need a platform where they can
        get more out of their game collections.</p>
    <p>Game Trader provides gamers an opportunity to connect with other gamers in their local
        community, and setup trades that benefit both parties. Game Trader’s strength is its flexibility –
        gamers may make whatever deal they want. Maybe you have no use for that old Nintendo in the
        garage, but another gamer across town may really want it, and may be willing to trade some
        newer games that you’ve been itching to buy. Or maybe you have simply finished a game, and
        just want a new one. How many other gamers in your community are in the exact same situation,
        but the game they finished is the next one you’re interested in? The possibilities are nearly
        limitless, and gamers even have the option to trade miscellaneous collectibles as well.</p>
    <p>Connecting gamers within their local communities is an important aspect of Game Trader. Most
        gamers don’t want to have to deal with the costs and hassles of shipping, let alone receive a
        damaged product. Like other services such as LetGo and Craigslist, Game Trader encourages
        gamers to see the item in person before the trade is completed, and a rating system is available to
        ensure positive experiences.</p>
